# Building LeanOS -- AI Business OS for solo founders

One person. Full business team. 186 skills. 41 agents. 8 domains.

## What It Is

A structured system of skills and agents that run an entire business through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Not a chatbot. Not a prompt library. Markdown instruction files that Claude reads and executes.

```
.claude/
  skills/     # 186 specialized skills (markdown files)
  agents/     # 41 orchestrating agents (markdown files)
```

**Domains:** Build, Sell, Serve, Orchestrate, Plan, Think, Learn, Operate

Every skill is a readable `.md` file. No compiled code. No hidden prompts. `cat` any file.

## How It Works

Skills and agents are markdown files. Context is shared across all business functions through a single repo -- strategy informs sales, customer feedback informs product, metrics inform everything.

**Requirements:** Claude Code subscription
**Setup:** Copy `.claude/` into your repo. Run `claude`.
**Time to first value:** Under 60 minutes.
**Data format:** Plain text, markdown, YAML. No vendor lock-in.
